# Substitute

An application that relays the messages exchanged between a user and another application.

*Substitute* is a command line tool of the same kind (although much less sophisticated) as [InBetween](https://www.chessprogramming.org/InBetween) by Odd Gunnar Malin, or as [UciFilter](http://www.nnuss.de/Hermann/UciFilter.html) by Volker Annuss. Instead of starting an engine, you start *Substitute* with the engine name as parameter (or written in **substitute.ini**). Substitute creates a file (**substitute.log**) where you can see the messages sent by the user and the messages sent by the engine.

*Substitute* is a Pascal program, for the Free Pascal Compiler. It has been tested only under Linux, but should work also under other environments.
